 	<h3>Biography</h3>
 	<p>This summer I participated in the Bloomberg Arts and Careers internship. It was very insightful and gave me alot of useful editing tips. I learned how to use Premiere Pro and I managed the PBS show "Art 21"'s social media pages and managed the production aspects that were posted. So I made little 20 second videos summarizing a new artists.In college though, I would like to study criminology, photography and alot of the subcategories that go along with forensics.</p>
	<p>My name is French. And I really like chipotle. I ws born in Alexandria Virginia. I came here when I was about 7 months. I lived in Southside Jamaica for about my whole life. I like to cook, read and write poetry. During my internship in the summer I performed one of my poems in front of 75 people. I like to sleep alot and I hope to dabble in Fashion and Fashion Photography when I get older. I like to go thrifting on my free time and I build lego architecture sets.</p>
	
	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p>I have a Windows computer, a I-Phone 6s and Airpods. I use the macbook pro computer laptops at school. I guess my tv counts as technology and my microwave.</p>
